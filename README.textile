h1. Eat This Now! (Scala)

Pragmatically, Eat This Now! is a dummy project I'm using to kick the tires on various web development frameworks. I plan to build it multiple times to feel out strengths and weaknesses of each framework/language. This version is written using "Play! Framework 2.0":https://github.com/playframework/Play20, in Scala.

Functionally, it is an app that reminds you to eat leftovers or other food items before they go bad.
